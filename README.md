# project52
A resolution to write a coding project every week.

## Background:

I was inspired by [kkdai](https://github.com/kkdai/project52), so I decided to make a project52 of my own.

## Constraint:

These are the constraints of my Project52:
- The projects can be of any size, but I have to learn something new (language/framework/library/algorithm/formula) through the project.
- I don't need to create all noval projects. They can be redone with a twist or just done in a different language or with a spin.

## Progress:
